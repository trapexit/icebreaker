# Icebreaker

This repo contains the source code to the 1995 strategy/action 3DO
game Icebreaker[0] developed by Andrew Looney[1] for Magnet
Interactive Studios.

In early 2023, after being asked by members of the community,
Mr. Looney released the source code to Icebreaker under the GPLv3
license.

This repo was created on behalf of Mr. Looney by trapexit. The initial
code commit is completely unaltered from what was provided to the
community. The zip file originally containing the code was named
`ICEBREAKER 3DO 5.6 source code.zip`.
